  Lore: "Mighty battle-mage Norius was bested only once in battle, by the dark master
    himself. Even though he was named commander of the Master\u2019s legions, he
    was also stuck with the title of the Second, something that boastful warrior
    never forgot, nor forgave. Long before their final confrontation, Norius coveted
    revenge. Yet, there was no satisfaction to be found in his victory. The fact
    that their combined power was barely enough to defeat their mentor drove Norius
    further into madness. His new body was hence made as a perfect instrument of
    death, and battle-starved Norius yearns for a new chance to prove himself."
