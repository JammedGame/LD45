  Lore: 'Revolted by frailness of the human body, Armina the Vain transfigured her
    flesh, bone and sinew into a more pleasing, durable vessel. The unfortunate souls
    of her enemies have been cursed to roam the halls of this tomb, trapped in the
    smaller contraptions of similar, albeit far more simple making. As for Armina,
    she readily volunteered to be sealed alive as a sentry of the inner chambers,
    content to spend eternity in solitude, marveling at her new form. '
