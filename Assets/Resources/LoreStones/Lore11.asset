  Lore: Even though the Three managed to overpower their tutor, the battle left them
    a shriveled husks of their former selves. While Armina was more then happy to
    embrace her new form, the other two were not so willing. Desperate to save his
    life Marus the Allseeing chose to entomb his sentience in a stone sculpture,
    inspired by the crest of the noble order of clairvoyants he once led. Was it
    done as a sign of remorse, or to add insult to an injury is unknown, and the
    Monolith that is now Marus will surely give no answer.
