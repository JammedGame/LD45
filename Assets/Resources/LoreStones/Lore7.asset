  Lore: 'Things that strayed from light should be kept underground.  An endless maze
    for the body, soul and mind. Organs scattered, life essence locked away, every
    mention of their name erased. May their cursed souls find no rest, sentenced
    to a limbo between planes of reality, capable only of perceiving the passage
    of eons. '
